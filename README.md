# AdvanceAI Project Submission  
### Integrated Healthcare AI Framework  
**Centralized • Federated • Noise-Augmented • Integrated Learning**

This project implements a unified Healthcare AI system combining:
- **Centralized Learning (Accuracy)**
- **Federated Learning Simulation (Privacy)**
- **Noise-Augmented Defense Training (Robustness)**
- **Integrated Ensemble Model (Majority Vote)**

The system is evaluated on a custom breast cancer dataset (`synthetic_dataset_B.csv`)
as well as the sklearn fallback dataset.

### **1. Code/**
Contains all executable code and dataset files.

  - **centralized_federated_defense_model.ipynb**
  Includes the full Google Colab notebook:  
  This notebook implements:
  - Centralized MLP Classifier  
  - Federated Learning Simulation (2 nodes)  
  - Noise-Augmented Defense Model  
  - Integrated Ensemble (Majority Voting)  
  - Plots, predictions, classification reports  
  - Saving models to `Models/` folder  

- **synthetic_dataset_B.csv**  
  Custom dataset used for training and evaluation.  
  If missing, the notebook automatically falls back to the sklearn breast cancer dataset.

### **2. Models/**
This folder contains all trained models generated by the notebook:

- `central_model.pkl` — Centralized baseline model  
- `defense_model.pkl` — Noise-augmented adversarial defense model  
- `federated_node_1.pkl` — Federated simulated model (Node 1)  
- `federated_node_2.pkl` — Federated simulated model (Node 2)  
- `integrated_model.pkl` — Majority vote ensemble  
- `results.json` — Accuracy results summary  

These files can be loaded later using `joblib.load()`.

# How to Run the Code
### **Option 1 — Google Colab (Recommended)**
1. Open Google Colab:  
   https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Upload the notebook file:  
   `Code/sourcecode/centralized_federated_defense_model.ipynb`
3. Upload the dataset when prompted:  
   `synthetic_dataset_B.csv`
4. Run all cells (Runtime ? Run All)
5. Trained models and results will automatically be generated in the `/Models` folder.
